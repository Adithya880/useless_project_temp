# BREAKUP PREDICTOR üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name:TEAM-2

### Team Members
- Team Lead:ADITHYA SURESH-SCTCE TVM
- Member 2:NANDANA V-SCTCE TVM

### Project Description
[2-3 lines about what your project does]
Breakup Predictor: the tool nobody needed, but everyone‚Äôs secretly curious about. Upload a chat or drop a text ‚Äî we‚Äôll serve up a breakup score, a savage response, and a few red flags you didn‚Äôt ask for.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People have too much emotional clarity in relationships. What they really need is a chaotic AI that reads into texts, finds drama where there might be none, and delivers it with a splash of sarcasm.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By feeding your conversations to an emotionally unavailable AI, we predict your love life's doom ‚Äî complete with a breakup probability, flag color ratings, and roasted life advice. Because therapy is too expensive, but this is free (and way meaner).
